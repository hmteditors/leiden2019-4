Build a presentation with:

`pandoc -t revealjs presentation.md -s -o presentation.html --metadata pagetitle=presentation`

The result will be `presentation.html`.

The documentation for all this is [online](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc) (it is not great documentation).
